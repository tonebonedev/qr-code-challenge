## Overview

First challenge for me of this type trying to improve my basic HTML & CSS skills. I am happy with the end result for the desktop view and have tried where possible to use percentages or em / rem for sizes in order for the page to be responsive. I haven't learned about media queries yet so I haven't been able to adapt the page to mobile in a way that looks clean.
